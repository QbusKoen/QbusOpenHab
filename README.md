# QbusOpenHab
 This is the openHAB binding for Qbus.
 The binding can't communicate directly to the Qbus controller but uses a client server application.
 
 ## Client & Server
 The client & Server applications are written in vb.net and uses the Qbus DLL tom communicate with the Qbus controller.
 If you want to run these on a raspberry pi you must first install mono with the vb addon:
 
 'sudo apt-get install mono-runtime mono-vbnc mono-complete'
